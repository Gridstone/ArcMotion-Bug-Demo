    <string name="bug_desc">This demo shows the inconsistency between Android developers\' docs on how ArcMotion works and its actual implementation. Below is only one single
        selected case to illustrate the issue.\nAccording to the docs, when the vertical distance between 2 points is greater than their horizontal distance, the generated arc should be on
        an imaginary circle whose centre point is horizontally aligned with the end point. However, the actually generated curve has its circle\'s centre point
        horizontally aligned to the start point instead (this was found from reading the getPath() function\'s implementation). See attached image.</string>

    <string name="expected_documentation">By looking into the ArcMotion\'s source code, we believe the description matching the implementation would be: \"If the horizontal distance between the points is
        less than the vertical distance, then the circle\'s center point will be horizontally aligned with either the start point or the end point, whichever ensures the curve to follow the anticlockwise
        direction. If the vertical distance is less than the horizontal distance then the circle\'s centre point will be vertically aligned with either the start point or the end point, whichever
        ensures the curve to follow the anticlockwise direction\".</string>
